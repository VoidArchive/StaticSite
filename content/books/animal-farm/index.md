[< Back to Book Alcove](/)

George Orwell's *Animal Farm* is one of those books you probably got assigned in high school, and for good reason. It's short, sharp, and about as subtle as a sledgehammer to the face when it comes to its political allegory. But hey, sometimes a sledgehammer is what you need.

## The Barnyard Revolution: A Quick Recap

The overworked and mistreated animals of Manor Farm, inspired by the wise old boar Major (basically Karl Marx with tusks), overthrow their human farmer, Mr. Jones. They establish Animal Farm, a society where all animals are equal, guided by the Seven Commandments of Animalism. Spoiler alert: it doesn't stay that way for long. The pigs, being the clever clogs they are, gradually take over.

## Why It's Still Kicking (Like Boxer the Horse, RIP)

* **Allegory So Clear, It's Painful:** This is a thinly veiled takedown of the Russian Revolution and the rise of Stalinism. Napoleon the pig is Stalin, Snowball is Trotsky, Squealer is propaganda personified (pigified?). It's a masterclass in using a simple story to explain complex and horrifying political realities.
* **"All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others.":** This line alone is iconic and chillingly relevant to, well, a lot of things, even today.
* **The Slow Creep of Tyranny:** Orwell brilliantly shows how revolutionary ideals can be corrupted, how language can be manipulated, and how power inevitably corrupts. The way the pigs gradually alter the commandments and gaslight the other animals is terrifyingly believable.
* **It's Short and Punchy:** You can read it in an afternoon, but it'll stick with you for a long time. No epic page counts here, just concentrated critique.

## Any Mud on This Farm?

If you're looking for a nuanced, multi-layered political thriller with complex characters, this ain't it. The characters are largely symbols, and the plot is fairly straightforward once you get the allegory. It's more a fable or a parable than a novel in the traditional sense.

## Oink if You Agree

*Animal Farm* is a classic for a reason. It's a powerful, timeless warning about the dangers of totalitarianism, the manipulation of truth, and the importance of vigilance. Plus, talking pigs are inherently a bit funny, even when they're becoming despots. A must-read, even if you already did for school.

Rating: 4 out of 5 revised commandments.
