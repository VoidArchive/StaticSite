[< Back to Book Alcove](/)

If you like your fantasy with a healthy dose of mud, blood, and morally ambiguous characters who make questionable life choices, then Joe Abercrombie's *The First Law* trilogy is for you. Forget chosen ones and noble quests; this is fantasy that spits in your eye and steals your wallet, and you somehow end up thanking it.

## What's This Grimy Business About?

The trilogy (*The Blade Itself*, *Before They Are Hanged*, *Last Argument of Kings*) follows a delightful cast of characters: Logen Ninefingers, a notorious barbarian trying (and mostly failing) to be a better man; Sand dan Glokta, a crippled ex-hero turned torturer with a wickedly cynical wit; and Jezal dan Luthar, a vain and foppish young nobleman who just wants to win a fencing tournament and get the girl. Their paths intertwine as war brews and an ancient conspiracy involving a bald wizard named Bayaz unfolds.

## Why It's Bloody Brilliant

* **Characters, Characters, Characters:** Abercrombie writes some of the best characters in fantasy. They are flawed, often unlikable, yet utterly compelling. Glokta's internal monologues are pure gold, and Logen's struggle with his violent nature is surprisingly poignant. You might not want to invite them over for dinner, but you'll hang on their every word.
* **Subverting Tropes:** Chosen one? Nope. Noble wizard mentor? Bayaz is... complicated. Epic battles where good triumphs over evil? More like messy, brutal slogs where everyone loses something. Abercrombie takes familiar fantasy tropes and twists them into something fresh and cynical.
* **Dark Humor:** This series is *dark*, but it's also incredibly funny. Glokta's biting sarcasm and the general absurdity of many situations provide a lot of laugh-out-loud moments, even amidst the carnage.
* **Realistic (ish) Brutality:** The violence is visceral and has consequences. Characters get hurt, stay hurt, and the psychological toll of war and violence is a constant theme. Say one thing for Joe Abercrombie, say he writes realistic pain.
* **Plot Twists That Hit Hard:** The plot is full of intrigue and betrayals, and Abercrombie isn't afraid to pull the rug out from under you. The ending of the trilogy is particularly... memorable.

## Potential Bruises

It's grim. Really grim. If you're looking for uplifting fantasy, this ain't it. Some readers might find the relentless cynicism and violence a bit much. And while the characters are fantastic, the plot can sometimes feel like it's secondary to their internal struggles and witty banter.

## The Verdict: Say One Thing For This Trilogy

...Say it's fantastic. *The First Law* is a landmark in grimdark fantasy. It's brutal, funny, and features some of the most unforgettable characters you'll ever encounter. Just be prepared to feel a little bit dirty afterwards. You have to be realistic about these things.

Rating: 5 out of 5 severed fingers (you'll understand).
