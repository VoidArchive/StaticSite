[‚Üê Return to Grimoire](/)

First contact with Roshar's storms. A world where gods died, but their blades remain.

## The Trials

### The Surgeon's Son

Honor dies, but men persist.
Bridge Four forms in blood and ash.
Death becomes strategy.
Wood and flesh transform into shield and spear.

### The King's Scholar

Ancient voices wake in storms.
Visions bleed through time's veil.
The Codes resurface from memory's depths.
The old ways remember what men forgot.

### The Broken Daughter

Necessity breeds deceit.
Pattern emerges from chaos.
Art transcends reality.
Her lies speak deeper truths.

## Elements of Power

### The Spren Bond

- Stormlight: Breath of gods, power of storms
- Lashing: Gravity bends to will
- Soulcasting: Matter remembers other forms
- Shardblades: Dead gods' fingers, cutting soul from flesh

### The Codes

- Unity before glory
- Journey before destination
- Life before death
- Strength before weakness

## Markers of Ascension

- Bridge Four transforms: slaves to spearmen to radiants
- Dalinar trades Blade for lives: power sacrificed, power gained
- Kaladin speaks the Words: oath becomes identity
- Shallan's art bleeds: memory becomes reality

## The Price

Immortal Blades demand mortal sacrifice. Every power has its spren. Every spren has its truth. Every truth has its breaking.

The storm comes. The words must be spoken.
