Mastery demands regression. This is a record of that descent.

## Current Trials

### The Inversion

First freestanding hold. Ten seconds of inverted clarity.
Wall holds achieved. The wall becomes a crutch.
Return to basics. Hollow body. Straight line. No compromise.
Next threshold: thirty seconds in void.

### The Ascension

Clean muscle-up. Three repetitions. Body weight becomes irrelevant.
Rings introduced. False grip burns pathways through forearms.
Failed ring transition. Shoulders lack the ancient knowledge.
The rings remember. The body must learn.

### The Lever

Advanced tuck. Fifteen seconds of horizontal meditation.
One leg extends. Eight seconds of asymmetric warfare.
Full lever attempts. Gravity remains undefeated.
The spine must become steel.

### The Float

Tuck planche. Twenty seconds of defying earth.
Advanced tuck attempts. Body remembers it's made of stone.
Return to support holds. Pride surrenders to foundation.
The ground teaches patience.

## Rites of Passage
