# Digital Grimoire

![A lone wolf overlooking a valley](/images/wolf.jpg)

Memory is code. Code is transformation.

## The Scribe

Backend architect from the peaks of Nepal. Go and Python shape reality.
SvelteKit weaves interfaces between worlds. When code sleeps, iron wakes.
The body becomes both laboratory and experiment.
