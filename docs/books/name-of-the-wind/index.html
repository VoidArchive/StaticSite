A story of seven strings. One man's descent into legend.</p><h2>The Trials</h2><h3>The Troupe's Son
The troupe burns. Innocence dies in arterial red.
Tarbean claims its prey. Streets teach survival's price.
Music returns. The lute remembers what the boy forgot.
Some wounds heal. Others transform.</h3><h3>The University's Child
Entry gained through pride and silver.
Sympathy mastered. Will becomes fire.
Naming whispers. The wind knows ancient tongues.
Knowledge demands blood. He pays gladly.</h3><h3>The Chandrian's Shadow
Blue flame haunts dreams. Memory becomes obsession.
Stories spiral. Truth hides in children's rhymes.
Names emerge. Power sleeps in syllables.
The past has teeth. They still hunger.</h3><h2>Elements of Power</h2><h3>The Arcanum
- Sympathy: Will bridges gaps
- Sygaldry: Runes remember purpose
- Naming: Reality bows to truth
- Music: Some songs can break a heart</h3><h3>The Principles
- Knowledge bleeds
- Silence has weight
- Names hold power
- Music remembers</h3><h2>Markers of Mastery</h2><ul><li>The lute strings sing: begging becomes art</li><li>Sympathy binds: mind conquers matter</li><li>Felurian yields: mortal masters fae</li><li>The wind obeys: name becomes truth</li></ul><h2>The Price</h2><p>Every legend demands its sacrifice. Every story needs its silence. Every name has its price.</p><p>Words are pale shadows of forgotten names. Names have power. Names can kill.</p></div>
