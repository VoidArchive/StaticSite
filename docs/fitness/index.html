      <article><div><h1>Iron Rites</h1><p><img src="/images/fitness.webp" alt="Mountain climber pose"></p><p>Mastery demands regression. This is a record of that descent.</p><h2>Current Trials</h2><h3>The Inversion</h3><p>First freestanding hold. Ten seconds of inverted clarity. Wall holds achieved. The wall becomes a crutch. Return to basics. Hollow body. Straight line. No compromise. Next threshold: thirty seconds in void.</p><h3>The Ascension</h3><p>Clean muscle-up. Three repetitions. Body weight becomes irrelevant. Rings introduced. False grip burns pathways through forearms. Failed ring transition. Shoulders lack the ancient knowledge. The rings remember. The body must learn.</p><h3>The Lever</h3><p>Advanced tuck. Fifteen seconds of horizontal meditation. One leg extends. Eight seconds of asymmetric warfare. Full lever attempts. Gravity remains undefeated. The spine must become steel.</p><h3>The Float</h3><p>Tuck planche. Twenty seconds of defying earth. Advanced tuck attempts. Body remembers it's made of stone. Return to support holds. Pride surrenders to foundation. The ground teaches patience.</p><h2>Rites of Passage</h2><h3>The Daily Invocation</h3><ul><li>Dawn: Mobility ritual. Joints remember freedom.</li><li>Dusk: Skill work. Movement patterns carved in muscle.</li><li>Night: Recovery. Tissue regenerates, memory deepens.</li></ul><h3>The Weekly Cycle</h3><ul><li>First Blood: Push until arms forget their limits</li><li>Second Blood: Pull until back becomes armor</li><li>Third Blood: Move like water</li><li>Fourth Blood: Full body integration</li><li>Fifth Blood: Pure skill acquisition</li><li>Sixth Blood: Active meditation</li><li>Seventh Blood: Void. Growth demands stillness.</li></ul><h2>Markers of Progress</h2><h3>Current Boundaries</h3><ul><li>Pull-ups: Twenty clean reps. Each one a battle with gravity.</li><li>Dips: Thirty reps. Shoulders speak ancient tongues.</li><li>Pistol Squats: Fifteen each side. Legs remember symmetry.</li><li>L-Sit: Thirty seconds. Core becomes stone.</li><li>Handstand: Ten seconds. Inverting reality.</li></ul><h3>Future Thresholds</h3><ul><li>Full planche: Five seconds of pure negation</li><li>Front lever: Ten seconds horizontal truth</li><li>Handstand push-ups: Five reps of inverted strength</li><li>One arm pull-up: Bilateral mastery</li><li>Freestanding handstand: Sixty seconds of vertical meditation</li></ul><h2>Laws of Iron</h2><ol><li>Consistency transcends intensity</li><li>Form is truth</li><li>Rest is transformation</li><li>Mind precedes muscle</li><li>Progress demands regression</li></ol><p>The body remembers what the mind forgets.
